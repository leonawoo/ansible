# host should be a member of domain ansible.vagrant; module will ensure the hostname is mydomainclient
# and will use the passed credentials to join domain if necessary.
# Ansible connection should use local credentials if possible.
# If a reboot is required, the second task will trigger one and wait until the host is available.
